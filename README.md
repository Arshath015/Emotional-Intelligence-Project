## Custom Model Training
1. Prepare your dataset and organize it into training folders (`data/train`).
2. Adjust the model configuration in `model_training.py` if needed.
3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python model_training.py
    ```

## Key Mappings
- Emotion-to-Rating Mapping:
    | Emotion | Rating |
    |---------|--------|
    | Happy   | 5      |
    | Neutral | 4      |
    | Sad     | 3      |
    | Fear    | 2      |
    | Angry   | 1      |

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Camera Access Issue**: Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
- **Missing Feedback File**: Create an empty `feedback.csv` in the `data/` folder.
- **Emotion Detection Error**: Check the DeepFace library setup and dependencies.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple users.
- Integrate additional emotion categories.
- Provide data analytics dashboards for visualizing trends.
